<p>This is the third article <a href="/query-builder">in a series</a> about
writing an SQL query builder in 150 lines of Python,

<ul>
<li>why I decided to write my own</li>

<h2 id="background">Background<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#background" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">reader</a></em> is a Python feed reader library –
it provides a high-level API for building feed readers,
allowing users to retrieve, store, and manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a>
without having to deal with feed-related details.</p>
<p>One of the main features is filtering articles:
by article metadata,
by user-set metadata (read, important, feeds tags),
and by full-text search,
sorted in different ways,
and with cursor pagination.</p>
<p>In May 2019,
with less than half of the above implemented,
the function building the SQL query was over 100 lines,
and I had already added <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/blob/7b47c88bb4e1388e7c5af1c269fb4a78e227120a/src/reader/_storage.py#L621">this comment</a>:</p>
<table class="highlighttable code-container"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre class="code"><code><span class="normal">612</span></code></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python"><span></span><code>        <span class="c1"># TODO: This needs some sort of query builder so badly.</span>
</code></pre></div>
</td></tr></table><h2 id="the-first-prototype">The first prototype<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#the-first-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>So I opened <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/issues/123">an issue</a>, and did some research.</p>
<p>At some point I stumbled upon <a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#short-manual-for-sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini</a>,
which was built around an interesting insight –
<em>queries can be represented as plain datastructures</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;first_name&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;FROM&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;author&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;WHERE&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;status&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;==&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">P</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;new&#39;</span><span class="p">)],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then modify the query directly:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;last_name&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or via a wrapper that simplifies navigation:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Q</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append_child</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>  <span class="c1"># path</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;age&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># returns self to allow method chaining</span>
<span class="go">&lt;sqlbuilder.mini.Q object&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!--

sql = [
    'SELECT', ['first_name'],
    'FROM', ['author'],
    'WHERE', ['status', '==', P('new')],
]
compile(sql)
sql[sql.index('SELECT') + 1].append('last_name')
compile(sql)
sql = Q(sql)
sql.append_child(
    ['SELECT'],  # path
    ['age']
)  # returns self to allow method chaining
compile(sql)

-->
<p>I really liked how simple and flexible this is,
and the choice of not dealing with SQL correctness or dialects –
a middle ground between build-your-own-string
and &quot;proper&quot; query builders.
On the other hand,
modifying things seemed too verbose (even with the wrapper),
and the output SQL didn't look very readable either.</p>
<p>Surely, it would be possible to take this idea
and make it look like <code>sql.SELECT('age')</code>, right?</p>
<p>So I made a prototype,
with no real intention of using it, just to see how easy it is to do.
The result was about 80 lines, and I was quite happy with it;
my thoughts at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The end result looks nice, but using it would add ~150 lines of code (that need to be tested), and it's less useful for simpler queries.</p>
<p>Also, it looks nice <em>now</em>, when I just wrote it; 6 months from now it may be hard to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afraid that I'm <em>too</em> happy with it, and with my curiosity satisfied,
I proceeded to do just that: wait six months.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">Requirements<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#requirements" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Whatever I ended up using, it had to support the following SQL features:</p>
<ul>
<li>SELECTs with conditional WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN etc.
(<a href="/query-builder-why#separation-of-concerns">example</a>)</li>
<li><a href="/query-builder-why#intermission-scrolling-window-queries">scrolling window queries</a></li>
<li>common table expressions (WITH)</li>
<li>arbitrary SQL (so I don't have to use the query builder for everything)</li>
</ul>
<p>Because <em>reader</em> is a library,
I wanted to keep the  number of (transitive) dependencies as small as possible,
since any extra dependency gets passed down to the users.</p>
<p>Also, the solution should be easy to understand and maintain,
and it should be possible to support additional SQL features, if needed.</p>
<p>At this point, I wasn't really sold on abstraction layer like SQLAlchemy Core.
Initially, raw SQL allowed me to move quicker, and I only needed to support SQLite anyway.
Now, SQLAlchemy core would be useful, but I still only need SQLite,
and don't really have time to make sure other datases work.
(It should be possible to switch to it relatively easily,
since all storage stuff happens through a DAO-style interface.)</p>
<h2 id="other-libraries">other libraries<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#other-libraries" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Because I was worried the temptation
to actually use my own query builder would be too great,
and would spiral into a project of its own with a huge maintenance burden,
I came up with the requirements above,
and did a more serious survey of existing libraries.</p>
<p>In the end, I didn't really like the existing libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li>they either came with a full-blown ORM,</li>
<li>either were an SQL builder with too many features,</li>
<li>either dind't really help with readability.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I decided to wait until the features would actually be implemented.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-to-write-my-own-the-second-prototype">deciding to write my own (the second prototype)<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#deciding-to-write-my-own-the-second-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>By May 2020, the function building the query was 150 lines,
with another half of that duplicated for search.
Due to the size and complexity, I ended up abandoning an attempt to use indexes,
because trying various things simply took too long.</p>
<p>So I did a second, more detailed prototype,
aiming to support all the current use cases and a few future ones.</p>
<p>- OR -</p>
<p>I did a more detailed prototype,
with all the features I'd need and some I didn't (nested queries etc.),
using the exact queries I needed as tests.
This remained at around 110 lines.</p>
<p>I integrated it, and that was that.
After doing this, the code went from 1400 to 1300 lines (excluding the 136 lines of the query builder itself).
I'd call this a win, since for the price of 36 lines I was able to reuse lots of logic, and enable future reuse and performance improvements (which did happen since).</p>
<ul>
<li>none of the existing libraries seemed appropriate</li>
<li>two prototypes offered an estimate of size, complexity, knew I could add more features; crucial to know it'd be easy to maintain, easy to undertand</li>
<li>already high test coverage, could rely on existing higher level tests</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't &quot;build&quot; the query; always shove everything into it and disable various bits through boolean parameters, and let the optimizer sort it out.</p>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The optimizer may not be able to optimize everything away, especially if the query is optimized before the parameters are passed in (so it doesn't get a change to remove stuff).</li>
<li>Some things we may not be able to turn off at all.</li>
<li>Do we still need to provide values for parameters used in the disabled bits? Probably yes.</li>
<li>Passing more parameters may be more expensive. Would it be more expensive than the string building, though?</li>
</ul>
<p>lots of cons, not doing it</p>
