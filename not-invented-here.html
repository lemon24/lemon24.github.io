<p>This is the third article <a href="/query-builder">in a series</a> about
writing an SQL query builder in 150 lines of Python,
<strong>why I wrote it</strong>, <strong>how I thought about it</strong>, and <strong>the decisions I had to make</strong>.</p>
<p>Today, we'll talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>why I decided to write my own</li>
<li>what alternatives I considered</li>
<li>why I didn't use an existing library</li>
<li>how I knew it wouldn't become a maintenance burden</li>

<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">reader</a></em> is a Python feed reader library –
it exposes a high-level API for building feed readers,
allowing users to retrieve, store, and manage Atom, RSS, and JSON feeds
without having to deal with feed-related details.</p>
<p>One of the main features is filtering articles in a number of ways:
by article metadata,
by user-set metadata (<em>read</em>, <em>important</em>, feeds tags),
by full-text search matches;
all these with various sort orders, and pagination support.</p>
<p>In May 2019,
less than half of the facets were implemented,
and <a href="/query-builder-why#separation-of-concerns">the function</a> doing it was 100 lines long;
at this point there's already <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/blob/7b47c88bb4e1388e7c5af1c269fb4a78e227120a/src/reader/_storage.py#L621">a comment</a> saying
&quot;this needs some sort of query builder so badly&quot;.</p>
<p>So I opened an issue for it,
did some research and a query builder prototype for fun
(that is, with no intention of using it, just to gauge how easy it is to do),
and shelved it for half a year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2020,
I did a more serious survey of possible solutions (including lots of libraries),
came up with a list requirements (which by now covered all the features mentioned above),
and ... decided to wait until the features would actually be implemented.</p>
<p>By May 2020, the function building the query was 150 lines,
with another half of that duplicated for search.
Due to the size and complexity, I ended up abandoning an attempt to use indexes,
because trying various things simply took too long.</p>
<p>So I did a second, more detailed prototype,
aiming to support all the current use cases and a few future ones.
I integrated it, and that was that.
After doing this, the code went from 1400 to 1300 lines (excluding the 136 lines of the query builder itself).
I'd call this a win, since for the price of 36 lines I was able to reuse lots of logic, and enable future reuse and performance improvements (which did happen since).</p>

<li>did survey of libraries, didn't like them (details below)</li>
<li>did two prototypes before deciding to start (had an estimate of size, complexity, knew I could add more features); crucial to know it'd be easy to maintain, easy to undertand</li>
