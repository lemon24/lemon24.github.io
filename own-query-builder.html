<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">reader</a></em> is a Python feed reader library –
it allows users to retrieve, store, and manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a>
through a high-level API,
without having to deal with feed-related details.</p>
<p>It is a hobby and learning project,
and I can only spend a limited amount of time on it,
sometimes quite far in between.
It's not necessarily about learning technologies;
rather, it is about library design,
writing code that's maintainable long-term, and showing restraint –
<em>if I were to make the best library I could,
what would it look like?</em></p>
<section class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Because of this,
 the conclusions of this article, if any,
 may not be <em>directly</em> applicable to regular &quot;work&quot; projects.
 With <em>reader</em>, I have different constraints over different time scales,
 a somewhat different definition of success,
 and more freedom in some aspects.</p>
<p>However, not all projects are the same,
 and not all parts of a project are the same.
 Sometimes, this kind of long-term thinking can be useful,
 and it can actually be achieved
 through a combination of planning,
 strategical technical debt,
 and saying no to, reducing the scope of, or postponing features.</p>
</section>
<p>In the spirit of keeping things maintainable,
the core library is fully typed and has 100% test coverage,
to make refactoring straightforward (if not painless).</p>
<p>Also, almost from the start,
I put all storage code in a single module,
behind a data access object<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>;
the rest of the library doesn't even know it's talking to a database.</p>
<p>One of <em>reader's</em> main features is filtering articles by
article metadata,
user-set metadata (read, important, feed tags),
and full-text search;
the results can be sorted in various ways and paginated.</p>
<p>In May 2019,
with less than half of the above implemented,
the function building the SQL query for was over 100 lines,
and I had already felt the need to add <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/blob/7b47c88bb4e1388e7c5af1c269fb4a78e227120a/src/reader/_storage.py#L621">this comment</a>:</p>

<p>This needs some sort of query builder so badly.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-prototype">The first prototype<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#the-first-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>I opened <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/issues/123">an issue</a>, and did some research.</p>
<p>At some point I stumbled upon <a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#short-manual-for-sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini</a>,
which was built around an interesting insight –
<em>queries can be represented as plain data structures</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;first_name&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;FROM&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;author&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;WHERE&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;status&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;==&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">P</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;new&#39;</span><span class="p">)],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then modify the query directly:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;last_name&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or via a wrapper that simplifies navigation:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Q</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append_child</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>  <span class="c1"># path</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;age&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># returns self to allow method chaining</span>
<span class="go">&lt;sqlbuilder.mini.Q object&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!--

sql = [
    'SELECT', ['first_name'],
    'FROM', ['author'],
    'WHERE', ['status', '==', P('new')],
]
compile(sql)
sql[sql.index('SELECT') + 1].append('last_name')
compile(sql)
sql = Q(sql)
sql.append_child(
    ['SELECT'],  # path
    ['age']
)  # returns self to allow method chaining
compile(sql)

-->
<p>I really liked how simple and flexible this is,
and the choice of not dealing with SQL correctness or dialects –
a middle ground between building strings by hand
and &quot;proper&quot; query builders.
On the other hand,
it seemed too verbose (even with the wrapper),
and the generated SQL wasn't very readable.</p>
<p>Surely, it would be possible to make this look like <code>sql.SELECT('age')</code>, right?</p>
<p>So I made a prototype –
with no real intention of using it, just to see how easy it is to do.
The core was quite short, about 80 lines; my thoughts at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The end result looks nice, but using it would add ~150 lines of code (that need to be tested), and it's less useful for simpler queries.</p>
<p>Also, it looks nice <em>now</em>, when I just wrote it; 6 months from now it may be hard to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afraid I'm <em>too</em> happy with it, and with my curiosity satisfied,
I did just that: postponed for six months.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-and-existing-libraries">Requirements, and existing libraries<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#requirements-and-existing-libraries" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>My main concern with building my own was that over time,
with additions and fixes,
the effort would be <em>greater</em> than
that of getting an existing library to do what I needed.</p>
<p>I did two things to deal with this.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, I wrote down detailed requirements.</p>
<p>Whatever I used had to support the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>SELECT with conditional WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN etc.
(<a href="/query-builder-why#separation-of-concerns">example</a>)</li>
<li>common table expressions (WITH)</li>
<li><a href="/query-builder-why#intermission-scrolling-window-queries">scrolling window queries</a>
(or be possible to build on top)</li>
<li>arbitrary SQL (so I don't have to use the query builder for everything)</li>
<li>the order in which you add clauses shouldn't matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, it should be easy to understand and maintain,
and it should be possible to support additional SQL features.</p>
<p>Because <em>reader</em> is a library,
I wanted to keep the number of (transitive) dependencies as small as possible,
since any extra dependency gets passed down to the users.</p>
<p>Both to keep things simple and due to <a href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev.html#why-use-sqlite-and-not-sqlalchemy">historical reasons</a>,
I did not want to switch to an abstraction layer like SQLAlchemy Core
<em>just</em> for query building –
I needed (and still need) only SQLite support,
and already had code to deal with stuff like migrations.</p>
<hr />
<p>Second, I did a slightly more serious survey of existing libraries.</p>
<p>I didn't feel any of the ones I looked at was ideal,
for at least one of these reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>They came with a full abstraction layer.
This isn't bad in itself,
but meant I had to switch <em>everything</em>, eventually –
using a mix would make things worse.</li>
<li>They had too many features.
Usually this is good, but it means there's more of everything:
more features, more documentation to go through,
more concepts to keep in your head,
more things contributors need to know or learn.</li>
<li>They didn't make things more readable or
more <a href="/query-builder-why#composition-and-reuse">composable</a>.</li>
<li>They weren't actively maintained.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Again, I chose to wait until more features are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-prototype">The second prototype<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#the-second-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>By May 2020, most of the features <em>were</em> implemented.
The function building the query was 150 lines,
with part of it duplicated for search.
At some point, I tried to optimize it to use indexes,
but gave up because trying things simply took too long.</p>
<p>So, <em>a full year later</em>,
I made the prototype support all the required features
and a few extra (UNION, nested queries),
and tried it out on the full real queries.</p>
<p>It didn't take all that long,
and it remained around 100 lines.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-to-use-my-own">Deciding to use my own<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#deciding-to-use-my-own" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>At this point, most of the work was already done, and integrating it took less than an hour.</p>
<p>Excluding the 136 lines of the builder itself with scrolling window query support,
the code went from 1400 to 1300 lines.
I took that as a win, since for the price of 36 lines I was able to reuse the filtering logic.
(Now, one year later, it enabled a lot more reuse, without growing significantly.)</p>
<p>I ended up keeping it, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an existing library would take too much effort.
(I'll reconsider when the requirements change, though.)</li>
<li>It is tiny, which makes it relatively easy to understand and modify;
the prototypes made me quite confident it's likely to stay that way.
Because it is only used internally,
I can leave out a lot of nice things that aren't actually needed
(including the extra features).</li>
<li>It has 0 dependencies. That's even better than 1.</li>
<li><em>reader</em> already had great test coverage,
so little additional testing was required.</li>
</ul>
<section class="admonition attention">
<p class="admonition-title">Attention</p>
<p>My query builder is not directly comparable with that of an ORM.
 Instead, it is an alternative to building <em>plain SQL</em> strings by hand.</p>
<p><strong>The caveats that apply to plain SQL apply to it as well:</strong>
 Using user-supplied values directly in an SQL query
 exposes you to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection</a> attacks.
 Instead, use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Parameterized_statements">parametrized queries</a> whenever possible,
 and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Escaping">escaping</a> only as a last resort.</p>
<p>Since I was coming from plain SQL, I was already doing all of this.</p>
</section>
<h2 id="other-alternatives">Other alternatives<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#other-alternatives" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of other things I looked at.
I'm only covering the libraries I actually considered using,
or that are interesting in some way.
There are others out there;
some aren't actively maintained,
some I simply missed.</p>
<p><small>(update)</small>
I added a few more interesting libraries after publishing the article.</p>
<h3 id="do-nothing">Do nothing<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#do-nothing" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>It's worth keeping in mind that &quot;do nothing&quot;
<a href="/sentinels#is-this-worth-a-pep">is always an option</a>
– probably the first option to consider, in many cases.</p>
<p>There's two kinds of doing nothing:
<em>passive</em>, where you wait for new requirements to come up
– for the problem to reveal itself –,
and <em>active</em>, where you explore options,
but don't commit to anything just yet.</p>
<p>I ended up doing both, to a point.</p>
<h3 id="disable-parts-of-the-query">Disable parts of the query<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#disable-parts-of-the-query" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>An interesting (but quickly abandoned) idea was to not build queries;
instead, have just one query,
and disable parts of it with boolean or optional parameters,
and hope the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html">query planner</a> optimizes it:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="SQL"><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">entries</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span>
    <span class="p">(:</span><span class="k">read</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">entries</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">read</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="k">read</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>  <span class="c1">-- 7 more expressions like this</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are two huge issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure <em>any</em> optimizer is that smart
(also, the query might be optimized before the parameters are passed in).
Even if it were, I'm not smart enough to design indexes for a query like this.</li>
<li>It doesn't seem possible to do it for JOIN, different ORDER BY terms,
or even an arbitrary number of WHERE conditions (e.g. for tags).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if they were all possible, the result would be almost impossible to understand.</p>
<h3 id="sqlalchemy-core-peewee-query-builder">SQLAlchemy Core, Peewee query builder<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlalchemy-core-peewee-query-builder" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> and <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/">Peewee</a> are both SQL toolkits / object-relational mappers.</p>
<p>SQLAlchemy has over 15 years of history,
and is <em>the</em> database toolkit for Python.
Hell, there's even an Architecture of Open Source Applications
<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html">chapter</a> about it.</p>
<p>Peewee is a bit younger (~10 years), simple and small by design.</p>
<p>Both have a lot of extensions<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-2"><a href="#fn-2">2</a></sup>,
and can be used without the ORM part;
Peewee can even generate <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/query_builder.html">plain SQL</a> without defining models.</p>
<p>In the end, both seemed too complicated,
and meant I had to switch to them eventually,
adding the burden of researching a use case I don't have yet.
However, if I ever need multi-database support,
it's likely I'll use one of them.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-3"><a href="#fn-3">3</a></sup></p>
<p><a id="sqlbuilder-pypika"></a></p>
<h3 id="sqlbuilder-pypika-python-sql">SQLBuilder, PyPika, python-sql<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlbuilder-pypika-python-sql" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SQLBuilder</a> and <a href="https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyPika</a> are standalone query builders
– no ORM, no connection management, just SQL generation;
they are similar to the Peewee query builder.</p>
<p>SQLBuilder doesn't seem actively maintained.
Aside from that, I didn't use it because it would make
a potential migration to SQLAlchemy or Peewee more difficult.</p>
<p>PyPika I discovered while writing this article;
it is actively maintained and has somewhat better documentation.</p>
<p><small>(update)</small>
Another actively maintained query builder is <a href="https://pypi.org/project/python-sql/">python-sql</a>.
It is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tryton">Tryton</a>, an open-source ERP platform;
it's been around for a while, and will likely continue to be.
I missed this one during my research :)</p>
<p><a id="sqlbuilder-mini"></a></p>
<h3 id="sqlbuilder-mini-psycopg2-sql">sqlbuilder.mini, psycopg2.sql<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlbuilder-mini-psycopg2-sql" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>SQLBuilder comes with another, extremely lightweight SQL builder, <a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#short-manual-for-sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini</a>.</p>
<p>As dicussed <a href="#the-first-prototype">in the beginning</a>,
I like the overall approach
(and at ~500 lines, it's small enough to vendor),
but it still seems verbose, and the generated SQL isn't very readable.</p>
<p><small>(update)</small>
<a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/sql.html">psycopg2.sql</a> has a similar philosophy in how it treats SQL strings.
Unlike my builder, it's &quot;inside-out&quot;
(you append stuff to lists explicitly),
so it's more verbose.
It does support escaping identifiers and placeholders, though;
I didn't really deal with that in any way.</p>
<p><a id="jinjasql-sqlpy"></a></p>
<h3 id="jinjasql-sqlpy-pugsql">JinjaSQL, SQLpy, PugSQL<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#jinjasql-sqlpy-pugsql" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>These two are interesting because they use templating.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sripathikrishnan/jinjasql">JinjaSQL</a> is exactly what you'd expect:
generate SQL from Jinja templates.
I didn't use it because composition
through macros would still be verbose,
and a bit tricky (careful with the comma after that last column).</p>
<p><small>(update)</small>
Template engines like Jinja are useful
if you need to allow <em>end users</em> to build queries,
since you can <a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/sandbox/">sandbox</a> templates
(sandboxing Python is not easy, at least <a href="https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2013-November/130132.html">not with CPython</a>).
<a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt">dbt</a>, brought to my attention by a reader,
seems to be using Jinja in this way.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/9fin/sqlpy">SQLpy</a> is similar, but different.
You put your named queries in a separate file,
and access them from Python as functions.
Query building happens via named parameters:
if you don't pass a parameter when executing the query,
the lines using that parameter aren't included in the query
(as you'd expect, this comes with a lot of <a href="https://sqlpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#built-sql">caveats</a>).</p>
<p><small>(update)</small>
I also re-discovered <a href="https://github.com/mcfunley/pugsql">PugSQL</a>,
which is like SQLpy, but is actively maintained
and doesn't do the magic line disappearing stuff.
Turns out they're both inspired by a pair of Clojure libraries.</p>
<p>If your SQL doesn't change, but is parametrized,
PugSQL looks like a good lightweight solution.
For me, adding WHERE conditions was a strong requirement.</p>
<h3 id="pony">Pony<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#pony" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>I don't think I considered <a href="https://ponyorm.org/">Pony</a> at the time,
but it's worth mentioning:
it has been around since 2012,
is actively maintained, and has commercial support.</p>
<p>And it can translate <a href="https://docs.ponyorm.org/queries.html">generator expressions</a> like this one into SQL queries:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python"><span></span><code><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Customer</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For <em>reader</em> it is definitely overkill.</p>
<p>It does look really, really interesting, though
(<a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">too interesting</a>, maybe?).</p>
