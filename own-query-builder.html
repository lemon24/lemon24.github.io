<p><em><a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">reader</a></em> is a Python feed reader library –
it provides a high-level API for building feed readers,
allowing users to retrieve, store, and manage <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_feed">web feeds</a>
without having to deal with feed-related details.</p>
<p>It's mostly a hobby / learning project,
so I can only spend a limited amount of time on it,
sometimes quite far in between.
It's not necessarily about learning technologies;
rather, it is about library design,
writing code that's maintainable long-term, and restraint –
<em>if I were to make the best library I could,
what would it look like?</em></p>
<section class="admonition note">
<div class="admonition-text">
<p>Because of this,
 the conclusions in this article, if any,
 may not be <em>directly</em> applicable to regular work projects.
 With <em>reader</em>, I have different constraints over different time scales,
 a somewhat different definition of success,
 and more freedom in some aspects.</p>
<p>However, not all projects are the same,
 and not all parts of a project are the same.
 Sometimes, this kind of long-term thinking can be useful,
 and it can actually be achieved
 through a combination of planning,
 saying no to or postponing some features,
 and strategical technical debt.</p>
</div>
</section>
<p>One of <em>reader's</em> main features is filtering articles:
by article metadata,
by user-set metadata (read, important, feeds tags),
and by full-text search,
sorted in different ways,
and with cursor pagination.</p>
<p>In May 2019,
with less than half of the above implemented,
the function building the SQL query was over 100 lines,
and I had already added <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/blob/7b47c88bb4e1388e7c5af1c269fb4a78e227120a/src/reader/_storage.py#L621">this comment</a>:</p>

<p>This needs some sort of query builder so badly.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="the-first-prototype">The first prototype<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#the-first-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>So I opened <a href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/issues/123">an issue</a>, and did some research.</p>
<p>At some point I stumbled upon <a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#short-manual-for-sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini</a>,
which was built around an interesting insight –
<em>queries can be represented as plain datastructures</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;first_name&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;FROM&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;author&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="s1">&#39;WHERE&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;status&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;==&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">P</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;new&#39;</span><span class="p">)],</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>You can then modify the query directly:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;last_name&#39;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Or via a wrapper that simplifies navigation:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python console session"><span></span><code><span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Q</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">append_child</span><span class="p">(</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;SELECT&#39;</span><span class="p">],</span>  <span class="c1"># path</span>
<span class="gp">... </span>    <span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">&#39;age&#39;</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="gp">... </span><span class="p">)</span>  <span class="c1"># returns self to allow method chaining</span>
<span class="go">&lt;sqlbuilder.mini.Q object&gt;</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="nb">compile</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sql</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="go">(&#39;SELECT first_name, last_name, age FROM author WHERE status == %s&#39;, [&#39;new&#39;])</span>
</code></pre></div>
<!--

sql = [
    'SELECT', ['first_name'],
    'FROM', ['author'],
    'WHERE', ['status', '==', P('new')],
]
compile(sql)
sql[sql.index('SELECT') + 1].append('last_name')
compile(sql)
sql = Q(sql)
sql.append_child(
    ['SELECT'],  # path
    ['age']
)  # returns self to allow method chaining
compile(sql)

-->
<p>I really liked how simple and flexible this is,
and the choice of not dealing with SQL correctness or dialects –
a middle ground between build-your-own-string
and &quot;proper&quot; query builders.
On the other hand,
modifying things seemed too verbose (even with the wrapper),
and the generated SQL is all on one line.</p>
<p>Surely, it would be possible to take this idea
and make it look like <code>sql.SELECT('age')</code>, right?</p>
<p>So I made a prototype,
with no real intention of using it, just to see how easy it is to do.
The result was about 80 lines, and I was quite happy with it;
my thoughts at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The end result looks nice, but using it would add ~150 lines of code (that need to be tested), and it's less useful for simpler queries.</p>
<p>Also, it looks nice <em>now</em>, when I just wrote it; 6 months from now it may be hard to understand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Afraid that I'm <em>too</em> happy with it, and with my curiosity satisfied,
I proceeded to do just that: wait six months.</p>
<h2 id="requirements-and-existing-libraries">Requirements, and existing libraries<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#requirements-and-existing-libraries" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>My main concern with making my own was that over time,
with various additions and fixes,
the effort spent on it would be <em>greater</em> than
getting an existing library to do what I needed.</p>
<p>To deal with it, I did two things.</p>
<hr />
<p>First, I came up with detailed requirements.</p>
<p>Whatever I ended up using, it had to support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>SELECT with conditional WHERE, ORDER BY, JOIN etc.
(<a href="/query-builder-why#separation-of-concerns">example</a>)</li>
<li><a href="/query-builder-why#intermission-scrolling-window-queries">scrolling window queries</a>
(should be possible to implement)</li>
<li>common table expressions (WITH)</li>
<li>arbitrary SQL (so I don't have to use the query builder for everything)</li>
<li>the order in which you add clauses shouldn't matter</li>
</ul>
<p>Because <em>reader</em> is a library,
I wanted to keep the number of (transitive) dependencies as small as possible,
since any extra dependency gets passed down to the users.</p>
<p>Also, the solution should be easy to understand and maintain,
and it should be possible to support additional SQL features, if needed.</p>
<p>Both to keep things simple and due to <a href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev.html#why-use-sqlite-and-not-sqlalchemy">historical reasons</a>,
I didn't want to switch to an abstraction layer like SQLAlchemy Core
<em>just</em> for query building –
I needed (and still need) only SQLite support,
and already had code to deal with stuff like migrations.</p>
<hr />
<p>Second, I did a slightly more serious survey of existing libraries.</p>
<p>I didn't feel any of the ones I looked at was ideal,
for at least one of the following reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>They came with a full abstraction layer.
This isn't bad in itself,
but meant I had to switch <em>everything</em>, eventually –
using a mix would make things worse long-term.</li>
<li>They had too many features.
Usually this is good, but it means there's more of everything:
more features, more documentation to go through,
more concepts to keep in your head,
more things contributors need to know/learn.</li>
<li>They didn't make things more readable or
more <a href="/query-builder-why#composition-and-reuse">composable</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>So I chose to do nothing, and wait until more features are implemented.</p>
<h2 id="the-second-prototype">The second prototype<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#the-second-prototype" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>By May 2020, most of the features were implemented.
The function building the query was 150 lines,
with part that duplicated for the search query.
At some point, I tried to optimize the query by using indexes,
but gave up because trying various things simply took too long.</p>
<p>So, <em>a full year later</em>,
I made the prototype support all the required features
and a few extra (UNION, nested queries),
and tried it out on the full real-world queries.</p>
<p>It didn't take all that long,
and the whole thing remained around 100 lines.</p>
<h2 id="deciding-to-use-my-own">Deciding to use my own<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#deciding-to-use-my-own" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>At this point, most of the work was already done, and integrating it took less than an hour.</p>
<p>Excluding the 136 lines of the builder itself with scrolling window query support,
the code went from 1400 to 1300 lines.
I took that as a win, since for the price of 36 lines I was able to reuse the filtering logic.
(Now, one year later, it enabled a lot more reuse, without growing significantly.)</p>
<p>I ended up keeping it, because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using an existing library would take too much effort.
(I'll reconsider when the requirements change, though.)</li>
<li>It is tiny, which makes it relatively easy to understand and modify.
The two prototypes made me quite confident it's likely to stay that way.
Because it's only used internally,
I can leave out a lot of nice things that aren't actually needed.</li>
<li>It has 0 dependencies. That's even better than 1.</li>
<li><em>reader</em> already great test coverage,
so very little additional testing was required.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-alternatives">Other alternatives<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#other-alternatives" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of other things I looked at.
I'm only covering the libraries I actually considered using,
or that are interesting in some way.
There are others out there;
some aren't actively maintained,
some I simply missed.</p>
<h3 id="do-nothing">Do nothing<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#do-nothing" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>It's worth keeping in mind that &quot;do nothing&quot;
<a href="/sentinels#is-this-worth-a-pep">is always an option</a>
– probably the first option to consider, in most cases.</p>
<p>There's two kinds of doing nothing:
<em>passive</em>, where you wait for new requirements to come up
– for the problem to reveal itself –,
and <em>active</em>, where you explore options,
but don't commit to anything just yet.</p>
<p>I ended up doing both, to a point.</p>
<h3 id="disable-parts-of-the-query">Disable parts of the query<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#disable-parts-of-the-query" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>An interesting (but quickly abandoned) idea was to not build queries;
instead, have just one query,
and disable parts of it with boolean or optional parameters,
and hope the <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/queryplanner.html">query planner</a> optimizes it:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="SQL"><span></span><code><span class="k">SELECT</span> <span class="p">...</span>
<span class="k">FROM</span> <span class="n">entries</span>
<span class="k">WHERE</span>
    <span class="p">(:</span><span class="k">read</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span> <span class="k">AND</span> <span class="n">entries</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">read</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">:</span><span class="k">read</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">AND</span>
    <span class="p">...</span>  <span class="c1">-- 7 more expressions like this</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are two huge issues with this:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm not sure <em>any</em> optimizer is that smart
(also, the query might be optimized before the parameters are passed in).
Even if it were, I'm not smart enough to design indexes for a query like this.</li>
<li>It doesn't seem possible to do it for JOIN, different ORDER BY terms,
or even WHERE conditions dealing an arbitrary number of parameters
(e.g. for tags).</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if all of these were possible, the result would be impossible to understand.</p>
<h3 id="sqlalchemy-core-peewee-query-builder">SQLAlchemy Core, Peewee query builder<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlalchemy-core-peewee-query-builder" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.sqlalchemy.org/">SQLAlchemy</a> and <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/">Peewee</a> are both SQL toolkits / ORMs.</p>
<p>SQLAlchemy has over 15 years of history,
and is probably <em>the</em> database toolkit for Python.
Hell, there's even an Architecture of Open Source Applications
<a href="http://aosabook.org/en/sqlalchemy.html">chapter</a> about it.</p>
<p>Peewee is a bit younger (~10 years), and simple and small by design.</p>
<p>Both have a lot of extensions<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>,
and can be used without the ORM part;
Peewee can even generate <a href="http://docs.peewee-orm.com/en/latest/peewee/query_builder.html">plain SQL</a> without defining models and so on.</p>
<p>In the end, both seemed too complicated,
and meant I had to switch to them eventually,
adding the burden of researching a use case I don't have yet.
However, if I ever need multi-database support,
it's likely I'll use one of them.</p>
<!-- TODO: for work project too -->
<h3 id="sqlbuilder-pypika">SQLBuilder, PyPika<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlbuilder-pypika" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p><a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SQLBuilder</a> (SmartSQL) and <a href="https://pypika.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyPika</a> are standalone query builders
– no ORM, no connection management, just SQL generation;
they are similar to the Peewee query builder.</p>
<p>SQLBuilder doesn't seem actively maintained since 2017.
Aside from this, I didn't use it because it would make
a potential migration to SQLAlchemy or Peewee more difficult.</p>
<p>PyPika I discovered while writing this article;
it is actively maintained, and has somewhat better documentation.</p>
<h3 id="sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#sqlbuilder-mini" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>SQLBuilder comes with another, extremely lightweight SQL builder, <a href="https://sqlbuilder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#short-manual-for-sqlbuilder-mini">sqlbuilder.mini</a>.</p>
<p>As dicussed <a href="#the-first-prototype">at the beginning of the article</a>,
I like the overall approach
(and at ~500 lines, it's small enough to vendor),
but it still seems verbose, and the generated SQL isn't very readable.</p>
<h3 id="jinjasql-sqlpy">JinjaSQL, SQLpy<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#jinjasql-sqlpy" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>These two are interesting because they use templating.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sripathikrishnan/jinjasql">JinjaSQL</a> is exactly what you'd expect:
generate SQL using Jinja templates.
I didn't use it because composition
through macros would still be verbose,
and a bit tricky (careful with the comma after that last column).</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/9fin/sqlpy">SQLpy</a> is similar, but different.
You put your named queries in a separate file,
and access them from Python as functions.
Query building happens via named parameters:
if you don't pass a parameter when executing the query,
the lines using that parameter aren't included in the query
(as you'd expect, this comes with a lot of <a href="https://sqlpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#built-sql">caveats</a>).</p>
<h3 id="pony">Pony<span class="headerlink"> <a href="#pony" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>I don't think I considered <a href="https://ponyorm.org/">Pony</a> at the time,
but it's worth mentioning:
it is an ORM that's been around since 2012,
is actively maintained, and has commercial support.</p>
<p>And it can translate this into an SQL query:</p>
<div class="highlight code-container"><pre class="code" data-lang="Python"><span></span><code><span class="n">select</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span> <span class="k">for</span> <span class="n">c</span> <span class="ow">in</span> <span class="n">Customer</span> <span class="k">if</span> <span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">orders</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">price</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> <span class="mi">1000</span><span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>For <em>reader</em> it is overkill.
It does look really interesting, though
– maybe <a href="http://boringtechnology.club/">too interesting</a>?.</p>
