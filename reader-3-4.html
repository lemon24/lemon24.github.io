<div class="column col-sm-12 col-md-10 col-8">

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>I'm happy to announce version 3.4 of <strong><a class="external" href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">reader</a></strong>, a Python feed reader library.</p>
<p>More importantly, reader is now 5 years old!</p>
<h2 id="5-years-2000-commits">5 years, 2000 commits<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#5-years-2000-commits" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>3.3, released in December, marks <em>reader</em>'s <a class="external" href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/commit/73ac0bd3b8d0e5429e0bd7caf5281e4c9c74f16d">5th anniversary</a> and its <a class="external" href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader/tree/3.3">2000th commit</a>.</p>
<p>I don't really know what to say,
so I'll just say something that maybe will help others.</p>
<p>I'm happy about <em>reader</em>.
But more than that,
I'm proud of it <em>growing into</em> what it is.</p>
<p><em>reader</em> started as a hobby and learning project,
scratch-your-own-itch kind of thing.
Starting off, I had two goals:
it should be a library,
and it should be for the long term.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref-1"><a href="#fn-1">1</a></sup></p>
<p>It continued beyond that, into an experiment.</p>
<p>First, on applying <a class="external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Hintjens">Pieter Hintjens</a>' <a class="external" href="https://hintjens.gitbooks.io/scalable-c/content/chapter1.html#problem-what-do-we-do-next">problem-solution</a> approach,
and the ideas in the
<a class="external" href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend</a> and
<a class="external" href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/176657481103/repeat-yourself-do-more-than-one-thing-and">Repeat yourself, do more than one thing, and rewrite everything</a>
essays by tef of <a class="external" href="https://programmingisterrible.com/">programming is terrible</a>.</p>
<p>Second, and more mundane, it was an exercise
in how testing and type checking
keep code maintainable over time.
&quot;Everyone knows&quot; they are good things™,
but most jobs rarely emphasize the <em>over time</em> part –
I know mine at the time didn't.
I wanted a place where I could get an intuitive feel for it.</p>
<p>(If you'd like to read more about any of the above, <a class="internal" href="/about#contact">do let me know</a>.)</p>
<p>Judging the success of either is probably highly subjective.
Nevertheless, <em>I think</em> they were both <em>wildly successful</em>.
<em>reader</em> is still alive and kicking,
despite the limited time I have for it,
and I've developed habits and ways of solving problems
that I'm constantly using in my professional life.</p>
<p>Sure, <em>reader</em> has flaws, and it's definitely not done (what is?),
but it's the longest project I've ever worked on,
and probably the best code I've ever written.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel I have to say that while not hugely popular,
<em>reader</em> is way more popular than I could've dreamt 5 years ago,
especially for a niche, but hopefully still relevant topic like web feeds.
Thank you!</p>
<h2 id="what-s-new">What's new?<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#what-s-new" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Here are the highlights since <a class="internal" href="/reader-3-0">reader 3.0</a>.</p>
<h3 id="parser-internal-api">Parser internal API<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#parser-internal-api" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<!-- 3.4 -->
<p>The parser <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internal.html">internal API</a> is fully documented.
It continues to be unstable,
but this is a huge first step on the road to internal API stabilization.</p>
<p>I started with the parser because
it's probably most useful for plugins
(for example, the <a class="internal" href="/reader-2-14#twitter-support">Twitter plugin</a> uses it extensively),
or if you want to retrieve and/or parse feeds with <em>reader</em>,
but handle storage and so on yourself
(here's a recipe for <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/internal.html#parsing-a-feed-retrieved-with-something-other-than-reader">parsing feeds retrieved with HTTPX</a>).</p>
<h3 id="faster-imports">Faster imports<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#faster-imports" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<!-- 3.3 -->
<p>The time from process start to usable Reader instance is 3x shorter,
by postponing update-related imports until actually needed.</p>
<h3 id="simpler-entry-sorting">Simpler entry sorting<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#simpler-entry-sorting" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<!-- 3.1 -->
<p>When sorting by <code>recent</code>,
newly added entries now always appear at the top,
regardless of their published date,
except on a feed's first update.</p>
<p>This replaces a more complicated heuristic
that caused entries added to a feed months after their published
(yup, that happens!)
to never appear at the top (so you would never see them).</p>
<h3 id="fewer-dependencies">Fewer dependencies<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#fewer-dependencies" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<!-- 3.1 -->
<p><em>reader</em> is a library, so I try to keep the number of dependencies as small as possible.</p>
<p>Starting with 3.1,
the <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#reader-readtime">readtime</a> built-in plugin has <em>no dependencies</em>,
and it can be used  even if lxml is not available
(the library I was using before to calculate read time
has a transitive dependency on lxml,
which does not always have PyPy Windows wheels).</p>
<h3 id="python-versions">Python versions<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#python-versions" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p><em>reader</em> 3.3 adds support for Python 3.11.</p>
<p><em>reader</em> 3.4 drops support for Python 3.8.</p>
<h3 id="bug-fixes">Bug fixes<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#bug-fixes" title="permalink">#</a></span></h3>
<p>There were lots of bug fixes,
mainly to plugins (I guess that's a good thing).</p>
<p>For more details, see the full <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html#version-3-4">changelog</a>.</p>

<p>That's it for now.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-reader">What is <em>reader</em>?<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#what-is-reader" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p><strong>reader</strong> takes care
of the core functionality required by a feed reader,
so you can focus on what makes <strong>yours</strong> different.</p>
<p><img class="img-responsive" src="/_file/reader-2-0/reader.png" alt="reader in action" />
<em>reader</em> allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>retrieve, store, and manage <strong>Atom</strong>, <strong>RSS</strong>, and <strong>JSON</strong> feeds<ul>
<li>and even follow <strong>Twitter</strong> accounts</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mark articles as read or important</li>
<li>add arbitrary tags/metadata to feeds and articles</li>
<li>filter feeds and articles</li>
<li>full-text search articles</li>
<li>get statistics on feed and user activity</li>
<li>write plugins to extend its functionality</li>
</ul>
<p>...all these with:</p>
<ul>
<li>a stable, clearly documented API</li>
<li>excellent test coverage</li>
<li>fully typed Python</li>
</ul>
<p>To find out more, check out the <a class="external" href="https://github.com/lemon24/reader">GitHub repo</a> and the <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">docs</a>,
or give the <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html">tutorial</a> a try.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-a-feed-reader-library">Why use a feed reader library?<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#why-use-a-feed-reader-library" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>Have you been unhappy with existing feed readers and wanted to make your own, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>never knew where to start?</li>
<li>it seemed like too much work?</li>
<li>you don't like writing backend code?</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you already working with <a class="external" href="https://feedparser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">feedparser</a>, but:</p>
<ul>
<li>want an easier way to store, filter, sort and search feeds and entries?</li>
<li>want to get back type-annotated objects instead of dicts?</li>
<li>want to restrict or deny file-system access?</li>
<li>want to change the way feeds are retrieved by using <a class="external" href="https://requests.readthedocs.io">Requests</a>?</li>
<li>want to also support <a class="external" href="https://jsonfeed.org/">JSON Feed</a>?</li>
<li>want to follow <a class="external" href="https://reader.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plugins.html#twitter">Twitter</a> accounts?</li>
<li>want to support custom information sources?</li>
</ul>
<p>... while still supporting all the feed types feedparser does?</p>
<p>If you answered yes to any of the above, <em>reader</em> can help.</p>
<h2 id="why-make-your-own-feed-reader">Why make your own feed reader?<span class="headerlink">&nbsp;<a href="#why-make-your-own-feed-reader" title="permalink">#</a></span></h2>
<p>So you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>have full control over your data</li>
<li>control what features it has or doesn't have</li>
<li>decide how much you pay for it</li>
<li>make sure it doesn't get closed while you're still using it</li>
<li>really, it's <a class="external" href="https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/10/26/fred/">easier than you think</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously, this may not be your cup of tea, but if it is, <em>reader</em> can help.</p>
