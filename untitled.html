<p>So, you're an &quot;advanced beginner&quot; –
you've learned your way past Python basics,
you know the syntax, and can solve real problems.</p>
<p>Maybe you're about to embark on your first larger project,
but feel at a loss about where to start from,
and how to structure it.</p>
<p>Maybe you're already midway through a large project (not even the first),
but don't know how to make the modules work together.</p>
<p>Maybe what started as a Pythonic script ended up as
not-so-beautiful modules and packages,
and it all gets messy, so quickly;
and you're afraid it will get worse as the project grows larger and larger,
leaving you with some piece of half finished software,
and with no motivation to follow it through,
the initial fun lost forever.</p>
<p>Maybe you read through tutorials and blog posts,
but found that most of them go straight to the solution,
without an in-depth look at possible alternatives.</p>
<p>Maybe you've read about architecture and design patterns,
but they seem too abstract, and you can't see how they apply to <em>your</em> code.</p>
<p>Maybe you're wandering if it's something you can learn at all,
or it's only meant for &quot;computer science people&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe you've been told you need to &quot;get more experience&quot;.
Maybe you've read that you have to develop an eye
by reading and writing a lot of code.
(While both of these are probably true,
they're not very helpful, and are kinda frustrating.
Where from? How? For how long? Can you speed it up?)</p>
<p>Maybe you've been told that refactoring is a part of life (it is!),
and doing it repeatedly is the best way to learn how it should have been done.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, you may feel it's taking way too long and you'll never get there.</p>
<p>Maybe you've been told to read the code of a project you like;
but they're too large, you don't know where to start, and even so,
from the code itself it's not obvious what the design philosophy was
and what choices were debated before settling on an implementation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>do not explain what was the design philosophy and what alternative choices were debated</p>

<p>I found the The Architecture of Open Source Applications books (both volumes) very helpful early in my career; they attempt to cover exactly that.</p>
<p>Note they can be a bit high level, although some of the chapters are more in-depth than others; also, most of the projects aren't in Python, which shouldn't stop you from reading them – there's a lot of wisdom in there :).</p>
<p>500 Lines or Less (same website) tries to address the level-of-detail issue by looking at purpose-made small projects (again, focusing on design decisions, not the code itself).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Architects look at thousands of buildings during their training, and study critiques of those buildings written by masters. In contrast, most software developers only ever get to know a handful of large programs well—usually programs they wrote themselves—and never study the great programs of history. As a result, they repeat one another's mistakes rather than building on one another's successes.</p>
<p>Our goal is to change that. In these two books, the authors of four dozen open source applications explain how their software is structured, and why. What are each program's major components? How do they interact? And what did their builders learn during their development? In answering these questions, the contributors to these books provide unique insights into how they think.</p>
<p>If you are a junior developer, and want to learn how your more experienced colleagues think, these books are the place to start. If you are an intermediate or senior developer, and want to see how your peers have solved hard design problems, these books can help you too.</p>
<hr />
<p>how it is structured, how its parts interact, why it's built that way, and what lessons have been learned that can be applied to other big design problems.</p>

<p>The first three volumes in the series were about big problems that big programs have to solve. For an engineer who is early in their career, it may be a challenge to understand and build upon programs that are much bigger than a few thousand lines of code, so, while big problems can be interesting to read about, they can also be challenging to learn from.</p>
